Hello! My name is Anmol Chandrakar and I am excited to join the Github community. As a beginner, I am eager to learn and contribute to the open-source community. With my passion for technology and coding, I am excited to be a part of this incredible platform.


I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to connect people and ideas. From an early age, I dabbled in coding and software development, but never had the opportunity to pursue it as a career. Now, I have decided to dedicate myself to learning and growing as a developer.

Although I am new to Github, I have already found the platform to be incredibly valuable. It is a place where developers can connect, collaborate, and share their work. The ability to find and contribute to existing projects has been a game-changer for me

As a beginner, I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement. I am actively reading tutorials, books, and taking online courses to expand my knowledge in programming languages, software development methodologies, and Github best practices.


My ultimate goal is to become a proficient Github user and contribute meaningfully to the open-source community. I am eager to collaborate with experienced developers and learn from their expertise. I am also excited about the idea of starting my own projects and seeing them come to life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my bio. I am excited to embark on this journey as a Github beginner and look forward to connecting with fellow developers and contributing to the open-source ecosystem. If you have any advice or recommendations, please feel free to reach out to me. Let's make something amazing together! ðŸš€
